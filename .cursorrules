-   Utilize parallel processing for fitness evaluation.
-   Implement elitism and diversity preservation techniques.
-   Create hybrid algorithms combining GA with local search.

Automata Theory and Formal Languages:

-   Create Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) with Îµ-transitions.
-   Design Pushdown Automata (PDA) for context-free language recognition.
-   Implement Turing Machine simulations.
-   Create algorithms for automata conversion (NFA to DFA).
-   Implement regular expression parsing and matching.
-   Design minimization algorithms for DFA.

MNIST Dataset Handling:

-   Implement efficient data loading and preprocessing.
-   Use proper train/validation/test splits.
-   Apply appropriate data augmentation techniques.
-   Implement batch processing for large datasets.

Visualization with Matplotlib:

-   Create clear and informative visualizations of data and results.
-   Implement proper styling and formatting of plots.
-   Use appropriate plot types for different data representations.
-   Create interactive visualizations when necessary.
-   Visualize automata state transitions and configurations.

Progress Monitoring:

-   Use tqdm for progress tracking in long-running operations.
-   Implement proper logging for algorithm progress.
-   Create informative progress displays for genetic algorithm generations.
-   Monitor and visualize fitness improvements over time.
-   Track automata execution steps and state changes.

Error Handling and Debugging:

-   Use try-except blocks for error-prone operations, especially in data loading.
-   Implement proper input validation and error messages.
-   Use debugging tools effectively when necessary.
-   Validate automata definitions and transitions.

Performance Optimization:

-   Utilize vectorized operations instead of loops where possible.
-   Implement efficient memory management for large datasets.
-   Profile code to identify and optimize bottlenecks.
-   Use appropriate data structures for different operations.
-   Optimize automata state transitions and memory usage.

Dependencies:

-   numpy
-   scikit-learn
-   matplotlib
-   tqdm (for progress bars)
-   pandas (optional, for data manipulation)
-   networkx (for automata visualization)
-   sympy (for formal language operations)

Key Conventions:

1. Begin projects with clear problem definition and data analysis.
2. Create modular code structures with separate files for algorithms, data processing, and visualization.
3. Use configuration files for algorithm parameters and settings.
4. Implement proper experiment tracking and result logging.
5. Use version control (e.g., git) for tracking changes in code and configurations.
6. Document formal language specifications and automata definitions.

VERY VERY IMPORTANT:

1. Follow .cursortasks to the core.
2. After you complete each task, update .cursortasks to check off any task
3. main.py is the entry point of the code.

Refer to the official documentation of NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and formal language theory resources for best practices and up-to-date implementations.
